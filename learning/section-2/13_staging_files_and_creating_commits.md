**1. Working with Commits (Code Snapshots)**
- Create Commits:
  - Stage changes for next commit
```cmd
git add <files(s)>
```
  - Create a commit that includes all staged changes
```cmd
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"
``` 
- Move between Commits:
  - Temporarily move to another commit
```cmd
git checkout <id>
```
- Get a chronologically ordered list of all the commits you have thus far
```cmd
git log
```
- Check current status of the git repository, which files are staged or not staged
```cmd
git status
```
