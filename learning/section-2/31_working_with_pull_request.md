**1. Pull requests**
- A pull request (PR) is a request to merge changes from one branch into another, typically from a feature branch into the main branch.
- To create a pull request, push your changes to a branch in your forked repository and then navigate to the original repository on GitHub.
- Click the "New pull request" button and select the branches you want to merge.
- Provide a title and description for your pull request, explaining the changes you've made.
- Once submitted, the pull request can be reviewed by collaborators, who can leave comments, request changes, or approve the changes.
- After approval, the pull request can be merged into the main branch.
