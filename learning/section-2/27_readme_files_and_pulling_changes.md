**1. README files**
- A README file is a documentation file that provides information about a project, including its purpose, how to install and use it, and any other relevant details.
- It is typically named `README.md` and written in Markdown format.
- A well-written README file is essential for helping users understand and contribute to the project.

**2. Pulling changes**
- To keep your local repository up to date with the remote repository, you need to pull changes from the remote repository.
- Use the command:
  ```
  git pull origin main
  ```
- This command fetches changes from the remote `main` branch and merges them into your local `main` branch.
- If there are any merge conflicts, you will need to resolve them before completing the pull.
