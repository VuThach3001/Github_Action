**1. Collaborators**
- Collaborators are individuals who contribute to a project but do not own the repository.
- They can be added to a repository by the owner, granting them permission to push changes directly.
- To add a collaborator, go to the repository settings, navigate to the "Collaborators" section, and invite the user by their GitHub username.
- Once added, collaborators can clone the repository, create branches, and push changes without forking.
- This workflow is useful for teams working on a shared codebase, as it simplifies the contribution process.

**2. Main branch protection**
- To prevent unauthorized changes to the main branch, repository owners can enable branch protection rules.
- These rules can require pull requests for changes, enforce code reviews, and prevent force pushes.
- To set up branch protection, go to the repository settings, navigate to the "Branches" section, and configure the desired rules.
- Therefore, once another user is added as a collaborator, they can still be restricted from pushing directly to the main branch if protection rules are in place and they need to create pull requests for their changes to be reviewed and merged.
