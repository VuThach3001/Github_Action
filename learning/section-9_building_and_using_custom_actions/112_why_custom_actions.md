**1. Why Custom Actions**
- Simplify workflow steps: 
  - Instead of writing multiple (possibly very complex) Step definitions, you can build and use a single custom Action
  - Multiple steps can be grouped into a single custom Action
- No existing (community) Action: 
  - Existing, public Actions might not solve the specific problem you have in your workflow, so you can build a custom Action to address that specific need.
  - Custom Actions can contain any logic you need to solve your specific workflow problem.
