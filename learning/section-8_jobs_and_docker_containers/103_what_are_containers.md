**1. Docker Container**
- A Docker container is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.
- Containers are isolated from each other and the host system, allowing for consistent and reproducible environments across different stages of development and deployment.
- Docker is a popular platform for creating, deploying, and managing containers, providing tools and services to simplify the containerization process.
- Containers can run on any system that supports Docker, making them highly portable and efficient for deploying applications in various environments, such as development, testing, and production.
- Containers are often used in microservices architectures, where each service is packaged in its own container, allowing for easier scaling, maintenance, and deployment of individual components of an application.
- Docker images are the building blocks of containers, and they can be created from a Dockerfile, which defines the instructions for building the image, including the base image, dependencies, and commands to run the application.
- Docker Hub is a popular registry for sharing and distributing Docker images, allowing developers to easily find and use pre-built images for various applications and services.
