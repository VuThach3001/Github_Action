**1. Activity Types**

- Activity types in GitHub Actions refer to the specific events that can trigger workflows. These include actions like pushing code, opening pull requests, and more.
- Understanding activity types is crucial for designing effective workflows, as it allows you to specify which events should trigger your automation.
- For example: **pull_request**, there would be a long list of activity types that can be used to filter when the workflow should `run`, such as `opened`, `closed`, `reopened`, `synchronized`, etc.
